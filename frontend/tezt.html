        <li> TCTD Challenge, Inter-IIT Tech Meet: ASME IIT Roorkee chapter participated in the 7th Inter IIT Technical
            Meet held in IIT Bombay and won GOLD in the TCTD (TATA center for Technology and design) challenge and
            General Championship among 22 other ITs. The competition’s central theme was “Farm tools that reduce
            drudgery and provide intelligent automation”, We designed and prototyped a “Black pepper Harvester”, a
            Robot which autonomously navigates, harvests, and collects the peppercorn for further processing. </li>
        <li> Using efficient mechanical systems and smart image processing techniques our robot completes this
            cumbersome process economically, paving way for better production on a global scale, as no such technology
            existed earlier.</li>
        <li> International Robotics Challenge (IRC): Every year IRC presents itself with challenging problem statements
            thus making the team explore new areas of robotics. It involves fabrication of 2 types of bots : manual and
            autonomous which would operate in coordination with each other to complete various challenging tasks. Team
            IRC won 2nd place in the national level and 3rd place in the international level at IRC 2017.</li>
        <li> HPVC: ASME’s International Human Powered Vehicle Challenge (HPVC) provides an opportunity for students to
            bring sound engineering design principles in the development of efficient, sustainable, fast and practical
            transportation alternatives. This competition is organized every year as a part of E-fest by ASME
            Asia-Pacific. ASME IIT R has engineered three vehicles on account of our three-year participation, Team
            Faith (2017), Team Nimbus 2k18(2018) and Team Prancer (2019).</li>
        <li> Student Design Challenge: SDC Conducted as part of E-fest ASME Asia Pacific challenges the technical
            skills, to create robots that perform various competitive tasks.Every year this theme-based competition
            comes up with innovative problem statements that involve 4-5 teams competing simultaneously. Team SDC
            participated for the first time this year and engineered robots that play football.</li>
        <li> Cognizance: Every year the Annual Tech Fest “Cognizance” of IIT Roorkee possess a series of problems
            statements in the field of robotics and ASME IITR participates and secures a place in the top three
            positions every year.</li>
        <li>Old Guard Oral Presentation Competition: This competition is designed to emphasize the value of an ability
            to deliver clear, concise and effective oral presentations. Two finalists from each E-Fest event are
            invited to compete at the Society level at the International Mechanical Engineering Congress & Exposition.
            One of our team members Vibhu Baibhav secured 1st position in Old Guard Oral Presentation held at E fest
            2016 along with $750 cash prize, getting a chance to represent Asia in Florida, USA at international level.</li>
        <li> ASME IAM3D Challenge: This Competition aims at re-engineering existing products or creates new designs
            that minimize energy consumption and/or improve energy efficiency. Team ASME IITR was in the TOP 3 teams,
            to be further mentored for competing at international level. "We designed an unmanned emergency resupply
            hovercraft using additive manufacturing that will pick up and carries a payload through a ground course and
            delivers the payload to its final destination. We used Ultimaker-2 3D printer which is available in <a href = "https://tinkeringlab.iitr.ac.in">Tinkering Lab</a>, and the material used is PLA and ABS. The design of our vehicle was done considering ease of
            printing and easy assembly of different components, which also provide ease of repairing and replacement if
            any components are faulty due to any reason like an error in printing. Brushless motors are used to inflate
            the skirt and to move the vehicle, and to turn, a rudder – servo mechanism is installed in the vehicle. To
            pick the payload rack & pinion gripping mechanism is used."</li>
        <li> Singapore Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Challenge: The SAUVC competition challenges participant teams to
            build an AUV which can perform given tasks. These tasks are simulations of tasks operational AUVs would
            have to be able to perform. The competition is held in a swimming pool and each team's AUV will have to
            perform 4 tasks. The speed and accuracy at which the AUV performs task will be used to decide the winner of
            the competition. The tasks involve four widely faced challenges underwater such as AUV navigation, visual
            identification, acoustic localization and robotic manipulation.</li>
